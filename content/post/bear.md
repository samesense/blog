This week I tried [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com)
and [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com) as lab notebook options. I've decided to
go with Bear, and pay its annual fee of $15.

I started my [notebook](samesense.blogspot.com/) in 2007 on blogger. I did not
like the search features. I briefly switched to a locally
hosted [ghost](https://ghost.org), but found that searching through posts and
updating ghost soured the experience. I've been using text files backup up to
GitHub for the past two years. I can search with grep/ag or GitHub's search
feature. I edit files in Emacs. I miss the ability to insert pictures, and
markdown-ish file structure I've adopted doesn't provide the visual cues that I'd
like, though I haven't learned org-mode. Ulysses has been mentioned in my news a
few times this past month, so I decided to try it out. It's nice for journaling,
but the annual subscription fee is $40, which has generated a lot of complaints.
Reading these led me to rediscover Bear, which I had initially written off as an
cheap Evernote clone.

After trying Bear, I found that its formatting and tagging schemes worked well
with the lab notebook organization I've been using. It uses Markdown to visually
highlight my task based headings, and its nested tag structure allows me to easily
jump between logs. There's also a way to link between notes, allowing me to
maintain project threads between days. Bear will export to text files, so when I
leave it, I can put all the files into GitHub again.
