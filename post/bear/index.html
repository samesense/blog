			 	<h1>bear notebook</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Fri, Sep 1, 2017</span>
			      <p>This week I tried <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a>
and <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bear</a> as lab notebook options. I&rsquo;ve decided to
go with Bear, and pay its annual fee of $15.</p>
<p>I started my <a href="samesense.blogspot.com/">notebook</a> in 2007 on blogger. I did not
like the search features. I briefly switched to a locally
hosted <a href="https://ghost.org">ghost</a>, but found that searching through posts and
updating ghost soured the experience. I&rsquo;ve been using text files backed up to
GitHub for the past two years. I can search with grep/ag or GitHub&rsquo;s search
feature. I edit files in Emacs. I miss the ability to insert pictures, and the
markdown-ish file structure I&rsquo;ve adopted doesn&rsquo;t provide the visual cues that
I&rsquo;d like, though I haven&rsquo;t learned org-mode. Ulysses has been mentioned in my
news a few times this past month, so I decided to try it out. It&rsquo;s nice for
journaling, but the annual subscription fee is $40, which has generated a lot of
complaints. Reading these diatribes led me to rediscover Bear, which I had
initially written off as an cheap Evernote clone.</p>
<p>After trying Bear, I found that its formatting and tagging schemes worked well
with the lab notebook organization I&rsquo;ve been using. It uses Markdown to visually
highlight my task based headings, and its nested tag structure allows me to
easily jump search entries by topic. There&rsquo;s also a way to link notes, allowing
me to maintain project threads between days. Bear will export text files, so
when I leave it, I can put all the files into GitHub again.</p>
